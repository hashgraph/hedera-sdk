> class `Client`

Managed client for use on the Hedera Hashgraph network.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### ** Java **

```java
// create from..
var network = new HashMap<String, AccountId>();
network.put("0.testnet.hedera.com:50211", new AccountId(3));

var client = Client.forMainnet(); // pre-defined
var client = Client.forNetwork(newtork); // custom network
var client = Client.fromConfigFile("./client-config.json"); // configuration file
var client = Client.forName("testnet"); // named

// set operator (to use to pay transaction fees)
client.setOperator(operatorAccountId, operatorPrivateKey);
```

### ** JavaScript **

```javascript
// create from..
const network = {
    "0.testnet.hedera.com:50211": "0.0.3"
};

var client = Client.forMainnet(); // pre-defined
var client = Client.forNetwork(newtork); // custom network
var client = Client.fromConfigFile("./client-config.json"); // configuration file
var client = Client.forName("testnet"); // named

// set operator (to use to pay transaction fees)
client.setOperator(operatorAccountId, operatorPrivateKey);
```

### ** Go **

```go
// create from..
network := make(map[string]AccountID)
newtork["0.testnet.hedera.com:50211"] = AccountID{Account: 3}

client := ClientForMainnet(); // pre-defined
client := ClientForNetwork(newtork); // custom network
client, err := ClientFromConfigFile("./client-config.json"); // configuration file
client, err := ClientForName("testnet"); // named

// set operator (to use to pay transaction fees)
client.setOperator(operatorAccountId, operatorPrivateKey);

### Static Methods

##### `forNetwork` ( `network`: `Map` < `String` , [`AccountId`](reference/cryptocurrency/AccountId.md) > ): `Client`

Construct a client for a specific network.

It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that all nodes
in the map are part of the same Hedera network. Failure to do
so will result in undefined behavior.

The client will load balance all requests to Hedera using
a simple round-robin scheme to chose nodes to send transactions
to. For one transaction, at most 1/3 of the nodes will be tried.

Network constants are made available to use.

---

##### `forMainnet` (): `Client`

Construct a Hedera client pre-configured for Mainnet access.

Will initially be filled with a hard-coded address book for the consensus node network, but in the background the client will immediately attempt to update its consensus node network using an [`AddressBookQuery`](reference/network/AddressBookQuery.md) against the mirror network.  If the query fails, the consensus node network will remain unchanged and the query failure will be logged.

---

##### `forTestnet` (): `Client`

Construct a Hedera client pre-configured for Testnet access.

Will initially be filled with a hard-coded address book for the consensus node network, but in the background the client will immediately attempt to update its consensus node network using an [`AddressBookQuery`](reference/network/AddressBookQuery.md) against the mirror network.  If the query fails, the consensus node network will remain unchanged and the query failure will be logged.

---

##### `forPreviewnet` (): `Client`

Construct a Hedera client pre-configured for Previewnet access.

Will initially be filled with a hard-coded address book for the consensus node network, but in the background the client will immediately attempt to update its consensus node network using an [`AddressBookQuery`](reference/network/AddressBookQuery.md) against the mirror network.  If the query fails, the consensus node network will remain unchanged and the query failure will be logged.

---

##### `forName` ( `name`: `String` ): `Client`

Construct a Hedera client for a given name.

Valid names are "previewnet", "testnet", "mainnet"

For a valid name, the behavior is idential to `for[Mainnet|Testnet|Previewnet]()`

---

##### `fromConfig` ( `data`: `String` ): `Client`

Configure a client from the JSON configuration string.

<details>
<summary><b>File Specification</b></summary>

`network` can be `mainnet`, `testnet`, `previewnet`, or a dictionary of Account
ID to IP:PORT

```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
}
```

or

```json
{
  "network": { "0.0.1": "0.testnet.hedera.com:50211" }
}
```

`operator` is an _optional_ object

```json
{
  "operator": {
    "accountId": "0.0.21",
    "privateKey": "302....",
  }
}
```

`mirrorNetwork` can be a network name (mainnet, previewnet, etc) or a list
of addresses. `mirrorNetwork` defaults to the name of `network` _if_ that is
a network name.

```json
{
  "mirrorNetwork": "mainnet",
}
```

or

```json
{
  "mirrorNetwork": [ "kabuto.sh:50211", "hedera.com:50211" ]
}
```

</details>

### Methods

---

##### `fromConfigFile` ( `filename`: `String` ): `Client`

---

##### `setOperator` ( `accountId`: [`AccountId`](reference/cryptocurrency/AccountId.md), `privateKey`: [`PrivateKey`](reference/cryptography/PrivateKey.md) ): `Client`

Sets the account that will, by default, pay for transactions and queries built
with this client.

---

##### `setOperatorWith` ( `accountId`: [`AccountId`](reference/cryptocurrency/AccountId.md), `publicKey`: [`PublicKey`](reference/cryptography/PublicKey.md), `transactionSigner`: `(bytes) => bytes` ): `Client`

Sets the account that will, by default, pay for transactions and queries built
with this client.

It is expected that the signing method utilize the private key associated
with the given public key.

This form is made available for integrating the SDK to sign
from an external source such as the Ledger Hardware Wallet.

---

##### `close` ()

Close all open connections with the Hedera network; and, release all
associated resources.

---

##### `ping` ( `nodeAccountId`: [`AccountId`](reference/cryptocurrency/AccountId.md))

Ping a single node

**NOTE**: This method will **not** throw if the node doesn't respond with a successful status code,
instead the network will de-prioritize it.

---

##### `pingAll` ()

Ping all nodes in the current network.

**NOTE**: This method will **not** throw if a node doesn't respond with a successful status code,
instead the network will de-prioritize it.

---

##### `setNetworkFromAddressBook` ( `addressBook`: `AddressBook`)

Replaces the current network with one which is given in an `AddressBook` (which presumably was acquired via an [`AddressBookQuery`](reference/network/AddressBookQuery.md))

---

### Properties

##### `network` () : `Map` < `String` , [`AccountId`](reference/cryptocurrency/AccountId.md) >

---

##### `mirrorNetwork` () : `List` < `String` >

---

##### `defaultMaxTransactionFee`: [`Hbar`](reference/Hbar.md)

**Write-only** The maximum fee to be paid for transactions executed by this client.

Defaults to 2 hbar.

---

##### `defaultMaxQueryPayment`: [`Hbar`](reference/Hbar.md)

**Write-only** The maximum payment allowable for queries.

Defaults to 1 hbar.

---

##### `operatorAccountId`: [`?AccountId`](reference/cryptocurrency/AccountId.md)

**Read-only**. Use `setOperator` or `setOperatorWith` to set.

---

##### `operatorPublicKey`: [`?PublicKey`](reference/cryptography/PublicKey.md)

**Read-only**. Use `setOperator` or `setOperatorWith` to set.

---

##### `requestTimeout`: `Duration`

---

##### `transportSecurity` () : `bool`

Enable or disable TLS for both networks.

---

##### `verifyCertificates` () : `bool`

Enable or disable TLS certificate verification

Only available in Java and Go SDKs

---

##### `ledgerId` () : [`LedgerId`](reference/LedgerId.md)

Enable or disable TLS certificate verification

Only available in Java and Go SDKs

---

##### `defaultRegenerateTransactionId`: `bool`

Declares if we should generate new transaction IDs when a transaction fails with
`TRANSACTION_EXPIRED`

**NOTE**: Defaults to `true`

**NOTE**: If transaction IDs are locked, this option is ignored. Transaction IDs can be
locked if set manually or if certain methods are called.

---

##### `networkUpdatePeriod`: `Duration?`

If present, the client will periodically attempt to update its consensus node network in the background using an [`AddressBookQuery`](reference/network/AddressBookQuery.md) against its current mirror network.  If the query fails, the consensus node network will remain unchanged and the query failure will be logged.

Defaults to 24 hours.
